# **Community Code of Conduct**

## **1\. Our Pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## **2\. Our Core Values**

To build a sustainable and healthy community, we adhere to five core values that guide our interactions:

1. **Mutual Respect:** We respect the dignity, opinions, and backgrounds of every individual, even when we disagree. We listen actively and avoid mockery or belittling.  
2. **Transparency:** We believe in open communication regarding decisions and actions, while maintaining necessary confidentiality for sensitive issues.  
3. **Accountability:** Every member, from the President to the newest recruit, is responsible for their actions and their impact on the community.  
4. **Inclusion:** We actively work to remove barriers and ensure that everyone has equal access to opportunities and feels a sense of belonging.  
5. **Commitment:** We value dedication. We honor our promises, deliver on our tasks, and respect the time and effort of our peers.

## **3\. Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
* **Conditioning a benefit (e.g., promotion, task assignment) in exchange for romantic or sexual favors (Quid Pro Quo).**  
* **Persistent unwelcome romantic attention or unconsented physical contact.**  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  
* Dismissing or mocking beginners' questions (e.g., "feigned surprise" or "well-actuallys")

## **4\. Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## **5\. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (online and offline), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## **6\. Enforcement (Standard Protocol)**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the contact details listed below. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## **7\. Enforcement Guidelines (Standard)**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### **1\. Correction**

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.  
Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### **2\. Warning**

Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### **3\. Temporary Ban**

Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### **4\. Permanent Ban**

Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## **8\. Operational Implementation & Accountability (Internal System)**

To ensure consistent application of the above guidelines in our daily operations, we use the following classification and **Strike System**. This helps us map specific behaviors to the standard guidelines.

### **Classification of Violations**

* **Category C (Minor Infractions \- Operational):**  
  * *Corresponds to "1. Correction".*  
  * **Examples:** Late task delivery (less than 24 hours) without prior notice, missing a regular meeting without excuse, minor disrespectful tone, "Ghosting" for 24 hours on urgent tasks.  
  * **Penalty:** **1 Strike**.  
* **Category B (Serious Infractions \- Professional):**  
  * *Corresponds to "2. Warning" or "3. Temporary Ban".*  
  * **Examples:** Accumulating 3 Strikes, complete failure to deliver a major project, ghosting for 3+ days, creating a hostile environment.  
  * **Penalty:** **Formal Warning** or **Probation**.  
* **Category A (Zero Tolerance Violations \- Ethical/Legal):**  
  * *Corresponds to "4. Permanent Ban".*  
  * **Examples:** Harassment (sexual/verbal), discrimination, theft of funds/IP, violence, doxing, or Quid Pro Quo violations.  
  * **Penalty:** **Immediate Removal**.

### **The Strike & Warning Mechanism (For Categories C & B)**

* **Accumulation Rule:** **3 Strikes \= 1 Formal Warning.** | **3 Warnings \= Removal.**  
* **The "Reset" Rule:** If a member maintains a clean record for **one month** after a Strike, one Strike will be removed.  
* **The "Redemption" Rule:** A member with a Strike can volunteer for a proactive "Redemption Task" (delivering high-quality work early or helping others) to remove a Strike immediately, subject to leadership approval.

## **9\. Conflict of Interest (Recusal Policy)**

To ensure fair judgment, any community leader who has a close personal relationship with one of the parties involved in a dispute, or who is directly involved in the incident, must **recuse** themselves from the investigation and decision-making process. The case will be handed over to a neutral leader or an ad-hoc committee.

## **10\. Privacy & Confidentiality**

We value your privacy. All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible. Details of the incident will only be shared with the specific leaders involved in the investigation. We will not publicly name the reporter without their explicit consent, unless required by law.

## **11\. Appeals Process**

Any member who believes they have been unfairly penalized has the right to appeal.

1. **Submission:** Submit a written appeal to the High Board within 7 days of the decision.  
2. **Review:** A neutral party (a different Head or High Board member not involved in the original decision) will review the case.  
3. **Decision:** The reviewer may uphold, reduce, or overturn the penalty based on new evidence or context. This decision is final.

## **12\. Reporting Guidelines**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the community leaders immediately via:

1. **Direct Email:**  
   * **Ali Arabi (President):** aliarabibbfftt@gmail.com  
   * **Salma Kelany (Vice President):** salmakelany480@gmail.com  
2. **Anonymous Reporting Form:** https://forms.gle/PwE3b3vv4oLe8k7x6
