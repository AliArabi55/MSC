# **🌟 Community Code of Conduct (ENHANCED v2.0)**

## **English Version \- Comprehensive & Professional**

Version: 2.0 \- Enhanced & Comprehensive  
Date: January 6, 2026  
Status: ✅ Official Binding Version  
Merged From: Microsoft, Python Foundation, and Community Standards

# **1\. Our Pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

# **2\. Our Core Values**

To build a sustainable and healthy community, we adhere to five core values that guide our interactions:

## **Mutual Respect**

We respect the dignity, opinions, and backgrounds of every individual, even when we disagree. We listen actively, avoid mockery or belittling, and demonstrate genuine understanding for others' perspectives and experiences. Respect means acknowledging different communication styles and making conscious efforts to include people who differ from us.

## **Lead with Empathy**

We listen with purpose, seeking to understand before being understood. We conduct ourselves professionally while showing kindness and compassion. We recognize that our words and actions have an impact on others, regardless of our intent.

## **Accountability & Ownership**

Every member, from the President to the newest recruit, is responsible for their actions and their impact on the community. We own our mistakes, apologize sincerely, and take steps to correct them. Leaders are held to an even higher standard of accountability.

## **Inclusion & Accessibility**

We actively work to remove barriers and ensure that everyone has equal access to opportunities and feels a sense of belonging. We prioritize the safety of marginalized groups over the comfort of privileged groups. We design our events and spaces to be accessible to all.

## **Commitment & Reliability**

We value dedication. We honor our promises, deliver on our tasks, and respect the time and effort of our peers. Reliability builds trust, and trust is the foundation of our community.

# **3\. Our Standards**

### **✅ Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people.  
* **Being respectful of differing opinions**, viewpoints, and experiences.  
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**.  
* **Accepting responsibility and apologizing** to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.  
* **Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals**, but for the overall community.  
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**.

### **❌ Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

* The use of **sexualized language or imagery**, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.  
* **Conditioning a benefit** (e.g., promotion, task assignment, mentorship) in exchange for romantic or sexual favors (**Quid Pro Quo**).  
* **Persistent unwelcome romantic attention** or unconsented physical contact.  
* **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks.  
* **Public or private harassment**.  
* **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (**Doxing**).  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.  
* **Dismissing or mocking beginners' questions** (e.g., "feigned surprise" or "well-actuallys").  
* **Gatekeeping:** Making others feel unwelcome because of their lack of technical knowledge or background.

# **4\. Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

# **5\. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within **all community spaces** (online and offline), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

**Examples of representing our community include:**

* Using an official e-mail address.  
* Posting via an official social media account.  
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.  
* Wearing community branded swag at public tech events.

# **6\. Classification of Violations**

To ensure transparency and fairness, violations are classified into three categories based on impact and severity:

## **Category C: Minor Infractions (Operational Issues)**

Behaviors that disrupt workflow or cause minor inconvenience but do not harm others personally. These are often "teachable moments."

* **Examples:**  
  * Late task delivery (less than 24 hours) without prior notice.  
  * Missing a regular meeting without excuse.  
  * Minor disrespectful tone in communication.  
  * "Ghosting" (not replying) for 24 hours on urgent tasks.  
  * Unintentional use of non-inclusive language (microaggressions).

## **Category B: Serious Infractions (Professional misconduct)**

Behaviors that significantly impact the team's progress, create a negative atmosphere, or repeat minor infractions.

* **Examples:**  
  * Repeating Category C infractions (accumulation).  
  * Complete failure to deliver a major project/task (blocking the team).  
  * Ghosting for 3+ days without explanation.  
  * Creating a hostile environment or persistent negativity.  
  * Refusing to accept feedback or correction.

## **Category A: Zero Tolerance Violations (Ethical/Legal)**

Severe behaviors that threaten safety, integrity, or legal standing. These result in immediate removal.

* **Examples:**  
  * Harassment or discrimination of any kind (sexual, racial, religious, etc.).  
  * **Quid Pro Quo** harassment.  
  * Theft of intellectual property or community funds.  
  * Physical violence or credible threats.  
  * Doxing (exposing private data).  
  * Retaliation against someone who reported a violation.

# **7\. Enforcement & Accountability System**

We believe in fairness, growth, and accountability. Our enforcement system is designed to **correct behavior** rather than just punish. We use a **Strike & Warning System** aligned with the categories above.

## **A. The Strike System (For Category C)**

A "Strike" is a formal note of a minor infraction. It serves as a wake-up call to improve performance.

* **Penalty:** 1 Strike per incident.  
* **Notification:** Private message from direct Lead/Head.  
* **Accumulation:** **3 Strikes \= 1 Formal Warning.**

## **B. The Warning & Probation System (For Category B)**

A "Warning" is a serious disciplinary action indicating that the member's position in the community is at risk.

* **Penalty:** Formal Written Warning \+ Probation Period.  
* **Probation:** Loss of voting rights or leadership privileges for a set time (e.g., 2 weeks).  
* **Accumulation:** **3 Warnings \= Removal from the Community.**

## **C. Immediate Removal (For Category A)**

Violations in Category A result in **immediate dismissal** without prior strikes or warnings. This decision is made by the High Board to protect the safety of the community.

## **D. The "Reset & Redemption" Rule (Inclusion Policy)**

We believe in second chances. Members can clear their record through commitment:

* **The Reset Rule:** If a member maintains a clean record for **one month** after a Strike, one Strike will be removed.  
* **The Redemption Task:** A member with a Strike can volunteer for a proactive "Redemption Task" (e.g., delivering high-quality work early, helping a peer, organizing a workshop) to remove a Strike immediately, subject to leadership approval.

# **8\. Enforcement Guidelines (Standard Protocol)**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### **1\. Correction**

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.  
Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### **2\. Warning**

Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### **3\. Temporary Ban**

Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### **4\. Permanent Ban**

Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

# **9\. Conflict of Interest (Recusal Policy)**

To ensure fair judgment, any community leader who has a close personal relationship with one of the parties involved in a dispute, or who is directly involved in the incident, must **recuse** themselves from the investigation and decision making process. The case will be handed over to a neutral leader or an ad-hoc committee.

# **10\. Privacy & Confidentiality**

We value your privacy. All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible. Details of the incident will only be shared with the specific leaders involved in the investigation. We will not publicly name the reporter without their explicit consent, unless required by law.

# **11\. Appeals Process**

Any member who believes they have been unfairly penalized has the right to appeal.

1. **Submission:** Submit a written appeal to the High Board within **7 days** of the decision.  
2. **Review:** A neutral party (a different Head or High Board member not involved in the original decision) will review the case.  
3. **Decision:** The reviewer may uphold, reduce, or overturn the penalty based on new evidence or context. **This decision is final.**

# **12\. Reporting Guidelines**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the community leaders immediately via:

### **1\. Direct Email (Confidential)**

* **Ali Arabi (President):** aliarabibbfftt@gmail.com  
* **Salma Kelany (Vice President):** salmakelany480@gmail.com

### **2\. Anonymous Reporting Form (Safe Space)**

* **Form Link:** https://forms.gle/PwE3b3vv4oLe8k7x6  
* *If you wish to report an incident in complete confidentiality without revealing your identity, you can fill out this form. We investigate all anonymous reports thoroughly.*

**We will handle all reports with discretion and confidentiality.**

# **13\. Investigation Procedure**

When a report is received, the following process is triggered:

1. **Receipt & Acknowledgment:** The reporter receives a confirmation within 24 hours that their report is being reviewed.  
2. **Assessment:** The designated leaders (or neutral committee) assess the report to determine if it is a Code of Conduct violation.  
3. **Investigation:** Leaders gather facts, screenshots, and interview witnesses (if applicable) while protecting the reporter's identity.  
4. **Resolution:** A decision on the appropriate action/penalty is made based on the "Enforcement Guidelines" and "Classification of Violations."  
5. **Notification:** Both parties are notified of the outcome (without revealing sensitive details).
