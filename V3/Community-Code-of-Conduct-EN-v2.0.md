# 1. Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

---

# 2. Our Core Values

To build a sustainable and healthy community, we adhere to five core values that guide our interactions:

## **Mutual Respect**
We respect the dignity, opinions, and backgrounds of every individual, even when we disagree. We listen actively, avoid mockery or belittling, and demonstrate genuine understanding for others' perspectives and experiences. Respect means acknowledging different communication styles and making conscious efforts to include people who differ from us.

## **Lead with Empathy**
We listen with purpose, seeking to understand before being understood. We conduct ourselves professionally while showing kindness and compassion. We recognize that people make mistakes and deserve support in correcting them. We assume good intent and interpret others' statements in good faith, while remaining aware of our impact on others' emotions and actions.

## **Transparency**
We believe in open communication regarding decisions and actions, while maintaining necessary confidentiality for sensitive issues. We clarify our intentions, decisions, and conflicts of interest clearly and honestly. We communicate productively and recognize that clear communication requires conscious effort.

## **Accountability**
Every member, from the President to the newest recruit, is responsible for their actions and their impact on the community. We take responsibility for our mistakes, apologize to those affected, and learn from the experience. We commit to delivering on our promises, maintaining high-quality work, and respecting the time and effort of our peers.

## **Inclusion & Belonging**
We actively work to remove barriers and ensure that everyone has equal access to opportunities and feels a sense of belonging. We celebrate diversity, promote welcoming environments, and work to understand the experiences of people different from ourselves. We make inclusive choices in our interactions and leadership.
