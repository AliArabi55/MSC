# **Community Code of Conduct**

## **1\. Our Pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## **2\. Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  
* Dismissing or mocking beginners' questions (e.g., "feigned surprise" or "well-actuallys")

## **3\. Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## **4\. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (online and offline), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## **5\. Classification of Violations**

To ensure transparency and fairness, violations are classified into three categories:

### **Category C: Minor Infractions (Operational)**

Behaviors that disrupt workflow or cause minor inconvenience but do not harm others personally.

* **Examples:**  
  * Late task delivery (less than 24 hours) without prior notice.  
  * Missing a regular meeting without excuse.  
  * Minor disrespectful tone in communication.  
  * "Ghosting" (not replying) for 24 hours on urgent tasks.

### **Category B: Serious Infractions (Professional)**

Behaviors that significantly impact the team's progress or create a negative atmosphere.

* **Examples:**  
  * Repeating Category C infractions (accumulation).  
  * Complete failure to deliver a major project/task.  
  * Ghosting for 3+ days.  
  * Creating a hostile environment or persistent negativity.

### **Category A: Zero Tolerance Violations (Ethical/Legal)**

Severe behaviors that threaten safety, integrity, or legal standing.

* **Examples:**  
  * Harassment or discrimination of any kind.  
  * Theft of intellectual property or community funds.  
  * Physical violence or credible threats.  
  * Doxing (exposing private data).

## **6\. Enforcement & Accountability System**

We believe in fairness, growth, and accountability. Our enforcement system is designed to correct behavior rather than just punish. We use a **Strike & Warning System** aligned with the categories above.

### **A. The Strike System (For Category C)**

A "Strike" is a formal note of a minor infraction. It serves as a wake-up call.

* **Penalty:** 1 Strike per incident.  
* **Accumulation:** **3 Strikes \= 1 Formal Warning.**

### **B. The Warning & Probation System (For Category B)**

A "Warning" is a serious disciplinary action indicating that the member's position in the community is at risk.

* **Penalty:** Formal Warning \+ Probation Period (Loss of voting rights or leadership privileges for a set time).  
* **Accumulation:** **3 Warnings \= Removal from the Community.**

### **C. Immediate Removal (For Category A)**

Violations in Category A result in **immediate dismissal** without prior strikes or warnings.

### **D. The "Reset & Redemption" Rule (Inclusion Policy)**

We believe in second chances. Members can clear their record through commitment:

* **The Reset Rule:** If a member maintains a clean record for **one month** after a Strike, one Strike will be removed.  
* **The Redemption Task:** A member with a Strike can volunteer for a proactive "Redemption Task" (delivering high-quality work early or helping others) to remove a Strike immediately, subject to leadership approval.

## **7\. Conflict of Interest (Recusal Policy)**

To ensure fair judgment, any community leader who has a close personal relationship with one of the parties involved in a dispute, or who is directly involved in the incident, must **recuse** themselves from the investigation and decision-making process. The case will be handed over to a neutral leader or an ad-hoc committee.

## **8\. Privacy & Confidentiality**

We value your privacy. All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible. Details of the incident will only be shared with the specific leaders involved in the investigation. We will not publicly name the reporter without their explicit consent, unless required by law.

## **9\. Appeals Process**

Any member who believes they have been unfairly penalized has the right to appeal.

1. **Submission:** Submit a written appeal to the High Board within 7 days of the decision.  
2. **Review:** A neutral party (a different Head or High Board member not involved in the original decision) will review the case.  
3. **Decision:** The reviewer may uphold, reduce, or overturn the penalty based on new evidence or context. This decision is final.

## **10\. Reporting Guidelines**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the community leaders immediately at: 
Ali Arabi (Founder) **\[aliarabibbfftt@gmail.com\]**.
Salma Kelany (Vice President) **\[salmakelany480@gmail.com\]**.

We will handle all reports with discretion and confidentiality.
